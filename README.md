I changed my code I decided to start all  over because my html css and javascript was long and to complicated so I decided to try again.
 

<!-- I added my  index.html file and the stylee.css file as well. 
I all ready stated some code.  Just basic html and some css.
I added a game.html file to the code which is the question html.
I coded the game.css for the game.
I added the questions and answers to the code in javaScript.
The questions also change when I refresh the screen not when I answer the question. 
I added a correct and incorrect answers when you get it right it flashes green when wrong it flashes red. -->
